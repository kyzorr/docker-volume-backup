# Docker Volume Backup Script

This Bash script provides an interactive TUI (dialog-based) interface for backing up and restoring Docker volumes, with support for scheduled backups and notifications via **Gotify** or **ntfy**.

---

## Features

- Backup all or selected Docker volumes
- Restore volumes from backups
- Automatic cleanup of old backups
- Schedule automatic backups via cron
- Interactive settings management (no manual file editing needed)
- Notification support: choose between **Gotify**, **ntfy**, or no notifications
- Adjustable notification priority for Gotify (e.g., high for errors, low for success)

---

## Requirements

- Linux system (tested on Debian/Ubuntu)
- Docker installed and running
- Bash shell
- `curl`
- `dialog` package installed  
  Install with:  
```
 
 sudo apt update && sudo apt install dialog curl
 
 ```
---

## Installation

1. **Download the script** and place it in your desired directory, e.g. `/usr/local/sbin/docker-backup/backup.sh`

```bash
 mkdir -p /usr/local/sbin/docker-backup/
 cd /usr/local/sbin/docker-backup/
 wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kyzorr/docker-volume-backup/refs/heads/main/backup.sh
 wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kyzorr/docker-volume-backup/refs/heads/main/settings.ini
 chmod +x backup.sh
```

 2. **(Optional) Create a system-wide alias**
 
 ```
 sudo ln -s /usr/local/sbin/docker-backup/backup.sh /usr/local/bin/backup-docker
 ```
 
 Now you can run the script as `backup-docker` from anywhere.
 
---

## Usage

Run the script with root privileges (required for Docker access):
 
 ```bash
 
 sudo /usr/local/sbin/docker-backup/backup_gui.sh

 ```
 # or, if you created the alias:
 ```bash
 sudo backup-docker
 ```

You will see a dialog-based menu with options for backup, restore, options, and settings.

### Main Menu

- **Backup:** Backup all or a single volume, or restore a volume.
- **Options:** Delete old backups, schedule or remove automatic backups.
- **Settings:** Configure general settings, notification system, and notification service parameters.

---

## Notifications

### Choose Your Notification System

- Go to **Settings > Notification System (Select)** and choose:
    - **none:** No notifications will be sent
    - **ntfy:** Use ntfy for notifications
    - **gotify:** Use Gotify for notifications


### Configure ntfy

- Fill in `NTFY_URL`, `NTFY_USER`, and `NTFY_PASS` in your `settings.ini`.
- Example:

```
NTFY_URL=https://ntfy.example.com/your-topic
NTFY_USER=myuser
NTFY_PASS=mypassword
```


### Configure Gotify

1. **Set up your Gotify server** and create an app to get your token.
2. Fill in `GOTIFY_URL` and `GOTIFY_TOKEN` in your `settings.ini`.
3. Optionally, set notification priorities for OK and error events:

```
GOTIFY_PRIORITY_OK=3
GOTIFY_PRIORITY_ERROR=9
```


---

## Testing Notifications

**Test Gotify from the command line:**

```bash
curl -L "https://your-gotify.example.com/message?token=your_app_token" \
  -F "title=Test" \
  -F "message=This is a test message" \
  -F "priority=5"
```

**Test ntfy from the command line:**

```bash
curl -u youruser:yourpassword -d "This is a test message" https://ntfy.example.com/your-topic
```

If you see the message in the web interface or app, notifications are working.

---

## Troubleshooting

- Make sure your `settings.ini` contains **no spaces around `=`** and **no quotes** around values.
- If notifications work via `curl` but not via the script:
    - Ensure `NOTIFY_SYSTEM` is set correctly.
    - Check the scriptâ€™s debug output (enable debug lines in the `send_notification` function).
    - Make sure the script is using the correct `settings.ini` (same directory).
    - If running via cron, check that the environment and permissions are correct.
- For Gotify, always use the **full HTTPS URL** (not HTTP if redirected).
- Check your Gotify or ntfy server logs if you receive no messages.

---

## Scheduling Backups

- Use the script's **Options > Schedule automatic backups** menu to set up a cron job for automated backups.

---

## Security

- Keep your notification tokens and credentials secure.
- Restrict access to the script and `settings.ini` file.
